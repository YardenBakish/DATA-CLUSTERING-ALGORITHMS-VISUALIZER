# Data-Clustering-Algorithms-Visualizer
Software Project Course - Implementation of Kmeans and Spectral Clustering algorithms in python integrated with C extensions 

The program can be executed via the following Linux command:
```bash
python3.8.5 -m invoke run -k -n --[no-] Random
```

flow
The project will flow along these lines (see later sections for an in-depth breakdown):
1. The user executes the program with certain arguments using the invoke library.
2. The program will generate random points that will be used for clustering.
3. The program will compute the clusters using two algorithms: the Normalized Spectral
Clustering and K-means.
4. The program will output:
• A file with the resulting clusters from both algorithms.
• A file containing the data points that were used.
• A visualization file comparing the resulting clusters of the two algorithms.
Your main program should be named main.py and it will act as the glue for your entire
project.
